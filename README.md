# Seriesfeed Import Time Wasted
Import your time wasted from Bierdopje.com to Seriesfeed.com
<br/>
Enjoy.
<br/><br/>
Version <strong>0.2.3</strong>

<a HREF="https://github.com/TomONeill/Seriesfeed-Import-Time-Wasted/raw/master/SeriesfeedImportTimeWasted.user.js">INSTALL</a>*

\* <strong>Requires the browser extension <a href="https://tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a></strong>

# What does this do?
With this userscript you can import your seen/obtained (time wasted) from Bierdopje.com to Seriesfeed.com.

# How do I use it?
You'll find a new button under the "Algemeen" menu item called "TW Importeren".<br />
In the first step, the userscript checks up on which account you're logged into on Bierdopje.com. If this information is correct, proceed to the next step. If not, log in and refresh the page.<br />
At step 2 your time wasted is being checked on availability. This means every single series is being checked on existance on Seriesfeed. Series which are not available on Seriesfeed yet are listed with an 'x'. You can request those and check back later. Check the checkboxes on the series you want the Time Wasted to be imported from and proceed.<br />
At the last step, the actual importing is being done. Every episode of every series is being checked one by one (could be several at the time depending on your browser and userscript version) and updated on Seriesfeed. This may take 30-60 minutes depending on your internet connection, browser and userscript version.

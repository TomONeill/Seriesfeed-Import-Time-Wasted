# Decrease the requests
Currently, this script takes an episode from Bierdopje.com,
converts the episode tag (SxxExx) to an id usable on Seriesfeed
and then checks if the episode was actually obtained/seen or not.

The obtained/seen status needs to be checked before that,
because now there are a lot of requests that are NOT needed.

# Three versions
There are three versions, but only the safe one works well.
Therefore, keeping all three versions seems a bit unnecessary
and will probably be removed in the future.
